different mesh formats.

The following command can be used to build cuboid:

  gcc -o ../cuboid cuboid.c -lm

Or, if you need support for HDF5 and OpenMP:

  gcc -o ../cuboid cuboid.c -DHAVE_HDF5 -lm -lhdf5 -fopenmp

Example usage:

  OMP_NUM_THREADS=8 ./cuboid --verbose --dolfin-xdmf-ascii --dx=100 --dy=100 --dz=100 >cuboid.xdmf

The above command generates a default mesh of the region
[0,20000]x[0,7000]x[0,3000] with a resolution of 100x100x100. The mesh
is written to standard output, which is redirected to the file
'cuboid.xdmf'. The mesh is written in the DOLFIN XDMF format, where,
data is stored as ASCII text embedded in an XML file. In this example,
the generated mesh consists of 442 401 vertices and 2 520 000 cells.

cuboid is free software. See the file COPYING for copying conditions.
